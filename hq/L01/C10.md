# HQ Base / L01 / C10 (Horrible Hats)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0007

## Briefing

> One of our agents has noticed something a little strange that she thought you might be able to look into. The Slootmaekers have a cycle hat creator tool on their website which allows you to select a combination of up to eight colors to go into a custom hat design. The tool itself didn't seem strange until we noticed the gang were sending each other links to hat color combinations they'd created on a regular basis that were a bit dull and had no other comment. It seems a little odd and we think they might be using it to hide **secret messages**.
>
> We've managed to get hold of an example output page which we think contains a **secret code word** the gang are using in other communications. If we could figure out that word it would really help us discover what their bigger plans are.
>
> Tip: See if you can **convert** the color **RGB numbers** into **letters** using the included **ASCII table** to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with some [RGB Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) (A method of representing colors in computers), and are told to decode them using an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) table. ASCII is a character encoding that maps numbers to characters.

Taking the provided numbers:

```
84 72 69
83 69 67
82 69 84
72 65 84
67 79 68
69 73 83
66 79 84
84 76 69
```

And encoding them into characters with the ASCII table yields the following:

```
T H E
S E C
R E T
H A T
C O D
E I S
B O T
T L E
```

Together the letters spell out this sentence:

```
THE SECRET HAT CODE IS BOTTLE
```
