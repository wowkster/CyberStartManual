# HQ Base / L01 / C05 (Mixed Messages)

## Briefing

> Our team have been monitoring some text message chatter between two of the senior gang members over the last week. There was nothing interesting of note until suddenly all their messages started coming through **mixed up**.
>
> At first we thought it might be a technical problem, but then it occurred to us that they might be deliberately **encoding the messages** somehow.
>
> I've had one of the agents forward you one of the messages, see if you can **decode it**.
>
> Tip: **Decode the message**, we think it mentions **two colours**, combine them (e.g. **redgreen**) and that's the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are given some encoded text:

```
IBEK OCLLCEITNO EW LPNA OT ATEK SI LBEU RO EYLLWO
```

Looking closely, it appears that the words are scrambled in a certain way that only changes the order of the letters.

Analyzing the text we can see that every 2 pairs of letters are swapped ("ta-ke" becomes "at-ek").

Decoding the text yields the following message:

```
BIKE COLLECTION WE PLAN TO TAKE IS BLUE OR YELLOW
```
