## Briefing

> Quick task for you agent, one of the gang, Lars De Vries, has written a post where he lists pictures of bikes he likes. Recently we've noticed some of the images are broken and he hasn't fixed it. Seems odd. **Take a look** at this page and see if you can **get the image to show**, perhaps take a look at the **source code of the page** and see if anything **doesn't look right**.
> 
> Tip: Find a way to **get the image to show** and you'll find the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are given a website with a broken image. Looking at the HTML of the page (F12 to open DevTools), we can see that this `img` tag has a `src` attribute that does not make sense. The url for the image is missing a file extension. Changing the `src` attribute to include the file extension `.jpg` yields the flag.
