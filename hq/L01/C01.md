## Briefing

> Agent, we think we might have a way to log into a social media account of one of the gang using the site's password reset form. We have two key pieces of information: his **username** and his **favourite color**. We just need his **age** and we'll be able to log in - can you **guess it from the information we already have**?
> 
> Tip: **Get the age correct** and submit the form to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with a password reset form. Some of the information is already filled in for us. The only blank field is the age.

Looking at the username (`lars_1986`) we can guess that 1986 is probably the user's birth year. 

Subtracting that from the current year will give us the user's age.

Submitting tht form with this age yields the flag.
