# HQ Base / L01 / C03 (Happy Customers)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0004

## Briefing

> During our initial analysis of the gang we noticed something strange - they created lists of their customers and shared it between their bike shops, and each customer had a unique pattern of numbers after their name. One of our agents thinks the pattern of numbers might be **encoded words**. We also noticed the **numbers never went above 26**, that might be relevant. Can you work out what it means?
>
> Tip: **Decode the message** to get the secret word and use that as the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are given some "encoded" words and a very large hint. We are told that the numbers range from 1-26 which is a large indication that these correlate to english letter (the alphabet has 26 letters).

Assigning a number to each letter starting at A->1, we get the following table:

| Number | Letter |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1      | A      |
| 2      | B      |
| 3      | C      |
| 4      | D      |
| 5      | E      |
| 6      | F      |
| 7      | G      |
| 8      | H      |
| 9      | I      |
| 10     | J      |
| 11     | K      |
| 12     | L      |
| 13     | M      |
| 14     | N      |
| 15     | O      |
| 16     | P      |
| 17     | Q      |
| 18     | R      |
| 19     | S      |
| 20     | T      |
| 21     | U      |
| 22     | V      |
| 23     | W      |
| 24     | X      |
| 25     | Y      |
| 26     | Z      |

Using this table, we can decode the message and get the flag.
