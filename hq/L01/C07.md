# HQ Base / L01 / C07 (Secret Caesar)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0001

## Briefing

> Our agents have been reviewing some documents they recovered from one of The Slootmaekers bike shops and they came across an order form for a set of six bikes which looks a little odd.
>
> We think the six bike reference numbers might be encrypted with a **Caesar Cipher** (which is where the letters are shifted along by a certain **offset**, e.g. if the letter is **A** and the offset is **2** it will become **C**), and we've got some intel that one of them contains a code that starts with the word "**BAR**". We've worked out that the offset for each code is determined by the **order quantity**. See if you can use that to break the encryption and find the hidden code.
>
> Tip: The **decrypted reference number** containing the word **BAR** is the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with some text encoded with a [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

Using an online Caesar Cipher decoder like [Cryptii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher) (make sure its on the decode setting), we can easily decode the messages. We know that all the offsets are the order quantities, so decoding the strings will yield the flag.
