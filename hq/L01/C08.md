# HQ Base / L01 / C08 (Hidden Report)

## Briefing

> One of the ways we've been investigating the gang and their bike shop is by actually buying products from them online. We've spotted a piece of functionality that we think might be exploitable, allowing us to get more information on other customers (some of which we think might actually be helping them with their plans to steal the eBikes).
>
> Have a look at our account page on the site, it allows you to **generate a report** of your transactions. See if you can find a way to view a transaction report for the very **first user** of the site.
>
> Tip: Find the **report for the first user** of the site and you'll get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are given a page that creates a user report. Something important that we can note is that the url for the report includes the User ID directly. This is called an [Insecure Direct Object Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecure_direct_object_reference). If we can change this input to a value we want, we might be able to access information that does not belong to us. This is called a [URL Manipulation Attack](https://ccm.net/contents/31-url-manipulation-attacks).

Manipulating the URL in this fashion to get the report of the user with ID `1` would look like this:

```
/account/transactions-user-1.txt
```

Navigating to this URL yields the flag.
