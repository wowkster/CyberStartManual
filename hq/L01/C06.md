# HQ Base / L01 / C06 (Executable)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0010

## Briefing

> Agent, quick question for you. One of the team sent me a screenshot of her filesystem browser with a bunch of files she recovered from a memory stick one of the gang discarded. She's asking if any of them are **executable files**. Take a look and let me know.
> 
> Tip: The **name of the executable file (including the extension)** is the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with a screenshot of a file folder, and asked to identify the executable file. 

Executable files come in lot of different varieties, but one less popular one (because it's old) is the [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COM_file) file format.

In the folder we can see one file that has a `.com` extension which is the flag.
