# HQ Base / L01 / C04 (Race To Where)

## Briefing

> Here's an interesting one for you agent - on the weekend the gang released what looks like a one page website advertising an upcoming bike race they're organising. Being cyber detectives we're naturally curious that things might not be as they seem. Have a look at the site - it looks like there are just two images on the page, a logo and the poster, can you **find** anything suspicious, maybe **some text**?
>
> Tip: Find the **hidden** clue and it'll lead you to the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we have a website that appears to be innocent. However, if we select all the text on the page with `Ctrl + a` (or looking at the HTML in DevTools), we find some hidden text that is the same color as the background of the page. It tells us to go to `/secret.html`.

Navigating to `/secret.html` in the URL search bar will yield the flag.
