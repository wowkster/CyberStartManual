## Briefing

> Agent, it looks like the gang are trying to raise some money to fund their plans - and they're doing so by sending fake banking emails to the customers of their bike shop to try and defraud them. Take a look at this email we intercepted, it's seemingly from a well known bank, but can you **spot anything suspicious with it**?
> 
> Tip: Click on the **part of the suspicious email** that makes you think it's fake and you'll get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with an intercepted email. We have to determine what part of the email makes it look suspicious.

The body of the email seems to be legitimate although maybe unrealistic. However, looking at the top of the email on the "From" line, we can see that the domain which sent the email is not `cloudninebank.com` like we would expect, but instead `cloudninebank`**k**`.com`. This gives away that the email is fake.
