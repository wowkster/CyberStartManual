# HQ Base / L01 / C11 (Tower of Wheels)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0006

## Briefing

> So, this is strange - our undercover agent noticed that one of the gang has left a set of bike wheels set up in his workshop like a **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle. We think it's wired up to his computer and might reveal something if our agent can complete the puzzle.
>
> We've mocked up the puzzle for you to try using JavaScript. You can move the wheels by entering the following command: **move(<src>, <dst>)**, where the **<src>** or <dst> values can be **"left"**, **"mid"**, or **"right"**. For example, to move a wheel from the middle lane to the left lane you need to type: **move("mid", "left")**. If you get stuck type **"reset()"** to start again.
>
> Tip: **Complete the puzzle** to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with a classic [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) puzzle. Solving it with JavaScript is trivial but here is an example solution:

```js
move("left", "right");
move("left", "mid");
move("right", "mid");
move("left", "right");
move("mid", "left");
move("mid", "right");
move("left", "right");
```

_One thing to note is that if the above code is run all at once, the game animation breaks, so I recommend running the commands one at a time._
