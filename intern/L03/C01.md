# Intern Base / L03 / C01 (Hextraordinary)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0156

## Briefing

> Intern, the agency have been in contact with a rival hacker who goes by the name "**ROXy**". She keeps telling us she runs a **logical operation**, particularly when analysing **differences in values**, but we're not sure what she means.
>
> ROXy is willing to work with us... if we can prove we're as smart as she is. Before handing over any information, she's given us a code to break first.
>
> If you can help us unravel this code, we'll gain an important new informant.
>
> Tip: The flag is the secret code.

## Solution

In this challenge, we are presented with 2 "codes". Looking at the structure of the strings, it is clear that these are [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) numbers. A common way to represent hexadecimal numbers is by starting them with `0x` to show that it should be interpreted as hex. This is also the case in javascript.

Reading the prompt we are meant to combine the numbers in some way, but it is not immediately clear how we should do so.

Reading further, the prompt mentions "logical operations". In the context of numbers this means [bitwise operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation).

There are several possible bitwise operations that we could use, but we get another hint from the prompt here. The hacker's name is **ROX**y and when read in reverse the capitalized letters spell "XOR". [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) is one of the common bitwise operations, so we know that it is the solution to our problem.

In JavaScript, there is a built in [XOR operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR) which is the caret symbol (`^`).

Running the following code in your console will yield another number:

```js
0xb105f00d ^ 0xaaa8400a;
```

The problem is that javascript represents the number in decimal by default and not hexadecimal. To convert the number to hexadecimal we can use the `toString()` function on JavaScript's Number type:

```js
(0xb105f00d ^ 0xaaa8400a).toString(16);
```

Here the `16` specifies that we want the number in base 16 (hex).

Running that code will yield the hexadecimal representation of the flag as a string. Prepending `0x` to the number will yield the flag.
