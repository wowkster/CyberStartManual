# Intern Base / L03 / C02 (Maths at Light Speed)

https://play.cyberstart.com/briefing/W0157

## Briefing

> Intern, I hope you know how to use a calculator? Of course you do. In theory you should be able to bypass this security gateway to a warehouse we believe holds clues to the whereabouts of a gang we are in hot pursuit of.
> 
> The thing is, the gateway was created by someone who loves doing everything **super fast**! You **only get 0.1 seconds** to answer the question asked by the gateway. Can you find a way around it? We're not able to **form**ulate an **action** quick enough.
> 
> Tip: Bypass the calculator lock to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge, we are presented with a lock that requires a fast speed to open. When we spin for a question, we only get a very short window to submit a result.

If we watch the HTML while the spinner is spinning, we can see that the `action` attribute on the submission form changes to `/flashfast/answer`. Then after the 0.1s of submission time runs out, the `action` attribute gets removed.

In HTML, the [`action` attribute](https://www.dofactory.com/html/form/action) (also hinted in the prompt) on a form dictates what happens when the form is submitted. More precisely, it specifies the url that the form results are sent to when the submit button is pressed. Given this information, we can understand why the form action disappearing when the time runs out would make the form unusable.

Armed with this knowledge of HTML forms, we can copy the url while it exists, and then add it back after it is removed. Setting the attribute back to `/flashfast/answer` after it is deleted allows us to submit the form with no time constraint.

With the attribute set, solving the given math problem will yield the flag.
