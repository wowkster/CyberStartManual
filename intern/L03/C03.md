# Intern Base / L03 / C03 (Off Balance)

## Briefing

> We're hot on the heels of catching this cyber gang but the closer we get, the more damage they try to inflict onto the Barcelona tourism industry!
>
> This time, they've hacked into a large international bank's mobile application. Customers of the bank are complaining they can't see their current **balance** and these criminal masterminds need to be held to **account**. Intern, help customers retrieve their balances, so they can continue to spend their money during their well-earned holidays!
>
> Helping our international friends will really help develop our **network**.

## Solution

In this challenge, we are presented with a mobile app interface for a banking application. It has multiple tabs for the different services, but the balances screen is blank.

Upon first inspection of the page, we see some HTML that has a `style="display: none;"` attribute which makes it invisible. However, this is actually a red herring. Looking further we can see that there is nothing of value in the HTML of the website.

Taking a little hint from the prompt, the next step is to look at the network tab in Dev Tools. We can see that each time a bottom tab is clicked, a [POST request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) is made to `cloudninebank.com`. Each tab makes a request to the following endpoints:

| Tab          | Endpoint                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Balances     | `https://cloudninebank.com/get-balances`     |
| Transactions | `https://cloudninebank.com/get-transactions` |
| Payments     | `https://cloudninebank.com/get-payments`     |

Out of these, the balances endpoint is the only one to return a [404 response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404). This means that nothing was found at the endpoint that was requested. We should be looking for a different endpoint that might have the data we are looking for.

In the response for the transactions and payments, there is a field in the JSON called `links` which includes a link to the root endpoint.

Making a POST request to `https://cloudninebank.com/` might give us some more information. We can make HTTP requests with JavaScript using the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). Running the following code in the JavaScript console will make a POST request for us.

```js
let res = await fetch("https://cloudninebank.com/", {
    method: "POST",
});
let json = await res.json();
console.log(json);
```

We get the following response:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "error": "No API token provided"
    }
}
```

The server wants us to provide some sort of API token.

Looking back to the transactions and payments requests, they include a body which includes an API token.

We can also include this token in our request like this (make sure to add the [Content-Type header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)):

```js
let res = await fetch("https://cloudninebank.com/", {
    method: "POST",
    body: "token=CNcsmXX5d50ZQCG5Us4twDi18awV",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
});
let json = await res.json();
console.log(json);
```

Executing this code returns the following response:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "endpoint": {
            "ref": "index",
            "protocol": "https://",
            "domain": "cloudninebank.com",
            "path": "/"
        },
        "user": {
            "id": "xgHof4h98"
        }
    },
    "links": {
        "get-accounts": "https://cloudninebank.com/get-accounts",
        "get-payments": "https://cloudninebank.com/get-payments",
        "get-transactions": "https://cloudninebank.com/get-transactions"
    }
}
```

We can see that the links here are different than what we expected. It appears the hackers have changed the `/get-balances` endpoint to `/get-accounts`.

Making a final request to this endpoint like so will yield the flag:

```js
let res = await fetch("https://cloudninebank.com/get-accounts", {
    method: "POST",
    body: "token=CNcsmXX5d50ZQCG5Us4twDi18awV",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
});
let json = await res.json();
console.log(json);
```
