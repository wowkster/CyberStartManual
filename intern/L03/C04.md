# Intern Base / L03 / C04 (The Final Countdown)

## Briefing

> The main tourism website for Barcelona has been hacked. The hackers have devised a program that changes the content of the website based on a timer. You can imagine the confusion this has been causing the sites visitors! Can you figure out how we can get the secret code to stop this program from running?
>
> It'll be tricky - they appear to use a **script** to **join multiple sets** of content together and finally **send the joined sets** to somewhere else to **validate**.
>
> Tip: The characters at the 5 URLs change quickly, but computers can be far quicker than humans, especially when getting data!

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with a unique problem. We need to make a request to all 5 URLs very quickly, and submit the result to another different endpoint. We could try and manually open each page, but with the imposed time restriction that would prove to be quite difficult. A better solution is to automate the requests with some JavaScript.

Firstly, we need to be able to make an HTTP request, and to do that we can use the [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). One small note is that when making HTTP requests from the console, your browser will not let you read the response unless you are on the same domain. This is a security feature called [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). It's not super important for this problem, but all you have to know is that to make the requests you will need to run the JavaScript on a page of the same domain.

Just make sure that before trying to make any requests, you navigate to https://roambarcelona.com/ and open your JavaScript console there.

The following JavaScript code is one example solution to this problem:

```js
// Define all the URLs
let urls = [
    "https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt1?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D",
    "https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt2?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D",
    "https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt3?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D",
    "https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt4?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D",
    "https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt5?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D",
];

// Create an array for storing the individual parts from each URL
let parts = [];

// Loop over the URLs and make an HTTP request for each one
for (let url of urls) {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const part = await res.text();

    // Store the result into the array
    parts.push(part);
}

// Create a string that we will append to in order to create our final code
let code = "";

// Add all the parts together to make the code
for (let part of parts) {
    code += part;
}

// Make an HTTP request to the final endpoint with the code we made to get the flag
let res = await fetch(
    `https://roambarcelona.com/get-flag?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D&string=${code}`
);
let flag = await res.text();

// Log the flag to the console
console.log(flag);
```

See if you can try and understand what each part of the code is doing. First we make an array with all our URLs. Then we make an HTTP request for each one and store the result. After that, we combine all the results into a single string and make a final request to the verification endpoint which yields the flag.

Keep in mind that if you run the code just as the timer is resetting, you might not get all the parts in time before the timer switches. If this happens, just run the code again and it should work.
