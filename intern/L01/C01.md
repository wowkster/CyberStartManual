# Intern Base / L01 / C01 (Hello World)

## Briefing

> Hello World
> We've found a profile page of a known hacker that we need to get in contact with but most of the information visible on the page is useless to us. However, there is one secret way to contact him - he's managed to inject on the page a hidden email address. Intern, we need you to find his email address!
> 
> Tip: The email address is the flag.


## Solution

In this challenge we are given the hint that the hidden email address is the flag. By selecting all the text on the page (Ctrl + a), we can see the email address in white text hidden in the page.
