# Intern Base / L01 / C03 (Social Engineering)

## Briefing

> Permission has been granted to try and log into the Chirp social media account of a hacker who goes by the name of **D4YDR3AM**. Luckily for us, they've been clumsy with their personal information. We know their dog's name is **Barkley** and they were born in **1993**. Can you use what we know about them to **guess their password** and get us into their account?
> 
> Tip: Get the flag by guessing the correct password to log into the account.


## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with a social media login page. We have found the user's username, and some details about them (their dogs name, and birth year). Some users choose these kinds of things to create their passwords and we can use that fact to guess their password. By concatenating their dog's name and their birth year, we get the password `Barkley1993`.
