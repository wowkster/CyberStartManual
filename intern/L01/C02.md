# Intern Base / L01 / C02 (Mixed Up Messages)

## Briefing

> We've been informed that a group of hackers are communicating cryptically on a social media site.
> 
> Their messages have been getting increasingly cryptic; so much so that all of the posts now look jumbled up and don't seem to make any sense!
> 
> We've found one post that we believe contains an important secret, and we need you to find out what that secret is so we can be ready to stop a possible cyber attack!
> 
> Tip: The secret is the flag.


## Solution

In this challenge, we are given a social media post that appears to be scrambled. 

```
!kcul dooG ."kcattakcah4emit" drow edoc tsop I nehw snalp ecnemmoC .eraperp dna secruoser lla rehtaG !won si kcatta ruo hcnual ot emit ehT
```

Upon further inspection, the message is actually just backwards. 

After reversing the text we get the following:

```
The time to launch our attack is now! Gather all resources and prepare. Commence plans when I post code word "time4hackattack". Good luck!
```

We are also given that the secret code is the flag.
