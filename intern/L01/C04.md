# Intern Base / L01 / C04 (Lazy Locked Login)

## Briefing

> Our Dutch office recently bought a new Internet of Things (IoT) connected fridge. However, the temperature settings have been widely fluctuating as of late. All agents are currently out in the field and too busy to fix the problem.
> 
> We know there is a remotely accessible technician's page where fridge **settings can be modified**, and that the fridge's login page **isn't very secure**. It was easy enough to find the username and password, but the form still has some **very lazy extra protection**. Intern, can you see if the rumours are true, fix our fridge, and help us verify this reported security vulnerability?

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with another login page, and are told that it isn't very secure. The form already has the username and password filled in, but the login button is disabled. By taking a look at the html (F12 to open DevTools) we can see that the developer left a hint in an HTML comment about the submit button:

```html
<!-- Developer notes: This will be disabled if page not accessed from technician's laptop. -->
```

The submit button has a `disabled` attribute on it, and by removing it we are able to login successfully.
