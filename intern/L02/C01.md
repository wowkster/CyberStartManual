## Briefing

> Weâ€™ve been working with a well-known spaceflight agency to help us launch a satellite into space. The satellite will monitor criminal cyber gangs and help us in our effort of preventing large-scale attacks.
>
> They have given us a command that triggers a **launch sequence** that will send a rocket with the satellite attached to its destination. The command is `launchRocket()` Can you figure out how we can run it so we can send this satellite to work?
>
> Tip: You can run JavaScript commands in the **Console**.

## Solution

In this challenge we are given a page where we are told that a specific command is accessible. We are given a hint that we can run commands in the JavaScript console. By opening DevTools (F12), and clicking the `Console` tab at the top, we have access to run any JavaScript we want. By pasting in the given command (`launchRocket()`), and running it (Enter), the rocket launches and the solution is revealed.
