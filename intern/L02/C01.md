# Intern Base / L02 / C01 (The Rocketeer)

## Briefing

> Weâ€™ve been working with a well-known spaceflight agency to help us launch a satellite into space. The satellite will monitor criminal cyber gangs and help us in our effort of preventing large-scale attacks.
> 
> They have given us a command that triggers a **launch sequence** that will send a rocket with the satellite attached to its destination. The command is `launchRocket()` Can you figure out how we can run it so we can send this satellite to work?
> 
> Tip: You can run JavaScript commands in the **Console**.


## Solution

In this challenge we are given a page where we are told that a specific command is accessible. We are given a hint that we can run commands in the JavaScript console. By opening DevTools (F12), and pasting in the given command (`launchRocket()`), the rocket launches and the solution is revealed.
