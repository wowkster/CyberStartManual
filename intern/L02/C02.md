# Intern Base / L02 / C02 (610enC0de'd Password)

## Briefing

> Agents believe they have found a server belonging to a gang called the Yakoottees. If we can get access to it who knows what information we can gather on them! So far the Yakoottees have been very successful hiding their activities by **encoding** everything they do. We've found their server but **don't have the password** and so can't login. Can you help, intern?

> Tip: Login to the server to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with a server login page. The login page has a banner with some cryptic text that looks suspiciously like a patter.

After further inspection, the text is a sequence of [escaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) characters. Specifically, it is a sequence of [Javascript-style escaped hexadecimal characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character#JavaScript). When you create a hex escape character, the value of the hex number corresponds to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) and Unicode character values.

A naive solution is to use an [ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters), and manually unescape the text.

An easier solution is to copy the string and remove all the whitespace. By pasting the result into the JavaScript console inside of quotes, the console will unescape the string for you automatically:

```js
"\x57\x65\x6c\x63\x6f\x6d\x65\x20\x74\x6f\x20\x74\x68\x65\x20\x36\x31\x30\x65\x6e\x43\x30\x64\x65\x20\x73\x65\x72\x76\x65\x72\x2e\x20\x54\x68\x65\x20\x73\x65\x72\x76\x65\x72\x20\x70\x61\x73\x73\x77\x6f\x72\x64\x20\x69\x73\x20\x34\x66\x31\x62\x32\x35\x32\x30\x35\x35\x20\x2d\x20\x67\x72\x65\x61\x74\x20\x64\x65\x63\x6f\x64\x69\x6e\x67\x20\x42\x54\x57\x2c\x20\x6c\x61\x74\x65\x72\x7a\x21";
```

The outputted result is the following:

```js
"Welcome to the 610enC0de server. The server password is 4f1b252055 - great decoding BTW, laterz!";
```

By taking that password and logging into the server we get the flag.
