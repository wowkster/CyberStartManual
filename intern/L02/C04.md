## Briefing

> A successful new start-up that sells electric scooters has discovered a handful of their customers' accounts have been hacked - guess who we believe might be behind it? Yep, you guessed it, the Yakoottees! Having only just entered the market and keen to maintain their otherwise excellent reputation, this business needs our help to run a security audit of their login system. Can you **spot any security holes**, perhaps some **leaked data**?

> Tip: Successfully login to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with another login page. When we take a look at the HTML, we find a script tag below the login form with a function called `doLogin()`.

```html
<script>
	function doLogin(submittedEmail, submittedPassword) {
		var alertError = get("alert-error");

		if (submittedEmail !== email || submittedPassword !== password) {
			alertError.style.display = "block";
			return;
		}

		executeLogin(submittedEmail, submittedPassword);
	}
</script>
```

Looking at this javascript, we can see that it compares the argument `submittedEmail` against a variable called `email`, and the argument `submittedPassword` against a variable called `password`.

Since the variables `email` and `password` are not defined in the scope of the function `doLogin()`, we can infer that they have to be global variables.

To see the values of global variables, we can type their name into the JavaScript console, and their value will be printed out.

Doing this, we get the credentials to the login page. Logging in will yield the flag.
