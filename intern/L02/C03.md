## Briefing

> Can you believe it, we think the Yakoottees are now planning to disrupt the flow of traffic in a major city! We need to **find the URL** of the **forum** they're using to communicate with each other. Can you figure out what the URL is and get to it? The **other links may be helpful**.
>
> Tip: Find the url of the forum to get the flag.

## Solution

In this challenge we are presented with some sort of website that the Yakoottees are using. There is a link to the forum that we want to access, but the link is disabled.

By looking at the HTML, we can see that all the links have a [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) called `data-sd` (the "sd" here stands for [subdomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain)). Some of the links also have an attribute called `data-id`.

The links have the following values of `data-sd`, and `data-id`:

| Link         | `data-sd`   | `data-id`   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Home         | `www`       |             |
| About        | `company`   |             |
| Cycling Maps | `my-routes` | `312324494` |
| Forum        | `my-chat`   | `312324494` |
| Contact      | `contact`   |             |

By clicking around we can quickly understand what each attribute does. Whenever we click a link, the subdomain in the URL bar updates to the value of `data-sd`. For example, when clicking on the About page (`data-sd` value of `company`), the full domain changes to `https://company.trafficdisruptors.com`.

Another observation is that when clicking on the Cycling Maps page (the only accessible page with a `data-id` attribute), the path changes to that value. For example, when clicking on the Cycling Maps page, the full url changes to `https://my-routes.trafficdisruptors.com/312324494`.

We can use these two observations together to deduce that the forum should be located at the url `https://my-chat.trafficdisruptors.com/312324494`.

By pasting that URL into the url bar, we can access the forum page and get the flag.
