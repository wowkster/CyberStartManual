# CyberStart Manual

Detailed Solutions to all of the [CyberStart America](https://cyberstart.com/) CTF challenges

## Format

This repository is split up into different folder for every base and every level. Inside each level there is a markdown file for every challenge with the 2022 solution and a detailed description of how to solve the challenge. _I cannot guarantee that these challenges will not change in the future, so if the briefing and/or challenge name does not match, it could be an indication that the challenge has changed._

## Flags

No flags are actually given in the solution sets, and that is intentional. It is more important that you understand the solution and can do it yourself, rather than just copy pasting the flag. Additionally, on some levels a custom flag is generated only for your user, and using a different auto-generated flag will affect your account.
